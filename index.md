## Thank **YOU** for making inspireWiT 2018 happen! :sparkling_heart: :sparkles:

inspireWiT 2018 was held at the [Broadway cinema](http://www.broadway.org.uk/) in central Nottingham. Our aims for the conference were:

- To showcase brilliant women and people of gender minorities in tech
- To inspire and encourage women and gender minorities to get involved in tech
- To provide a network for those already in the field
- To encourage people of all genders to consider diversity
- To have fun, meet new people and learn new things!

Thank you so much for helping us to achieve those goals.

## The important bit

We sent out a feedback form to our attendees and got 39 responses. Of these **100%** said they felt the event was comfortable and inclusive and **90%** of them got to know someone they didn't know before the event. The comfort of our attendees and facilitating interactions are extremely important aspects of the event to us so we are _thrilled_ with this! :purple_heart:

## Tickets and attendee info

:sparkles: **102 attendees** :sparkles: checked in at the event. With sponsor representatives, speakers, workshop runners and volunteers included that came to 146 people at the event. 30% of those who registered for tickets were no-shows, which from word-of-mouth I understand is at the lower end of what is to be expected for free events of this nature.

Of those willing to state their gender on our booking form, 80% of our attendees were women. Just over half of the attendees were students, with most coming from the University of Nottingham and the University of Sheffield.

## Our feedback highlights

Feedback from the event has been really positive. In particular, we had a huge amount of involvement on twitter - we collected the :purple_heart: highlights :purple_heart: [here](https://twitter.com/i/moments/982925267114053633)

Here are some of our favourite quotes from the above tweets and from our feedback form:

> it was really well put together! liked that you had an lgbt woman on the panel, and asking for pronouns on attendee's tags was really thoughtful. overall I wasn't sure what to expect but really enjoyed it, and all the other attendees I spoke to were fantastic. oh and the scarf is amazing! it's clear that a lot of work went into putting the day together and i enjoyed all of it/glad I came.

> A heartfelt thank you to the entire team and sponsors who made this event possible! I've been trying to teach myself Python, and it means a lot to be able to be at an event like this to meet others who also have varying degrees of expertise and engage in topics that I normally don't get to interact much with day to day. ... THANK YOU for keeping this free and accessible to all in its truest form

> Really well organised, excellent atmosphere, I came away very inspired!

> I’m so glad that inspireWIT was my first conference. Couldn’t have asked for a better day!

> inspireWIT has turned out to be a conference where every single person attending had the chance to open themselves to their true interests and dreams. One thing every single speaker had in common is their passion for what they do.

## More feedback: in numbers

The numbers collected have reflected how well we feel the day went. The averages we received are:

- :computer: Overall content of the day: 7.9/10
- :cinema: Venue: 8.2/10
- :bread: Food: 8.1/10
- :information_desk_person: Team: 9.2/10

We also collected which sponsors the attendees listed as their favourites and what they stated as their favourite piece of content of the day. People liked the sponsors for many reasons including appearing to be inclusive and genuinely committed to employing more women, hosting fun activities and having kind representatives to talk to and contirbuting great content to the day. All of the content was received really well - I don't think we can draw great conclusions on what the most valued content was since the attendees were spread between so many (**11!**) different workshops and we don't have the numbers on what workshops the attendees that filled out the feedback form went to but it's certainly nice that almost all of them got a mention!

## What next?

I'd like to say one last :purple_heart: **HUGE THANK YOU** :purple_heart: for all of your support in helping the event happen. If you would like a debriefing call then I would be more than happy to have one so please feel free to arrange one with me, or to send any other questions you have on the event via email.

The conference will be running again **next year**! Alexa Spors, who did all the graphic design for this years' event as well as providing lots of other organisational help, will be taking over as lead organiser with help from Hazel Seanor, who ran the Web Scraping and Bot Making with Python workshop and provided organisational support this year.
