## Thank YOU for making inspireWiT 2018 happen! :sparkling_heart: :sparkles:

inspireWiT 2018 was held at the [Broadway cinema](http://www.broadway.org.uk/) in central Nottingham. Our aims for the conference were:

- To showcase brilliant women and people of gender minorities in tech
- To inspire and encourage women and gender minorities to get involved in tech
- To provide a network for those already in the field
- To encourage people of all genders to consider diversity
- To have fun, meet new people and learn new things!

Thank you so much for helping us to achieve those goals.

## The important bit

We sent out a feedback form to our attendees and got 39 responses. Of these **100%** said they felt the event was comfortable and inclusive and **90%** of them got to know someone they didn't know before the event. The comfort of our attendees and facilitating interactions are extremely important aspects of the event to us so we are _thrilled_ with this! :purple_heart:

## Tickets and attendee info

:sparkles: **102 attendees** :sparkles: checked in at the event. With sponsor representatives, speakers, workshop runners and volunteers included that came to 146 people at the event. 30% of those who registered for tickets were no-shows, which from word-of-mouth I understand is at the lower end of what is to be expected for free events of this nature.

Of those willing to state their gender on our booking form, 80% of our attendees were women. Just over half of the attendees were students, with most coming from the University of Nottingham and the University of Sheffield.

## What people thought

Feedback from the event has been really positive. In particular, we had a huge amount of involvement on twitter - we collected the highlights [here](https://twitter.com/i/moments/982925267114053633)

Here are some of our favourite quotes from the above tweets and from our feedback form:

> it was really well put together! liked that you had an lgbt woman on the panel, and asking for pronouns on attendee's tags was really thoughtful. overall I wasn't sure what to expect but really enjoyed it, and all the other attendees I spoke to were fantastic. oh and the scarf is amazing! it's clear that a lot of work went into putting the day together and i enjoyed all of it/glad I came.

> A heartfelt thank you to the entire team and sponsors who made this event possible! I've been trying to teach myself Python, and it means a lot to be able to be at an event like this to meet others who also have varying degrees of expertise and engage in topics that I normally don't get to interact much with day to day. ... THANK YOU for keeping this free and accessible to all in its truest form

> Really well organised, excellent atmosphere, I came away very inspired!

> I’m so glad that @inspireWIT was my first conference. Couldn’t have asked for a better day!

> @inspireWIT has turned out to be a conference where every single person attending had the chance to open themselves to their true interests and dreams. One thing every single speaker had in common (@paulienuh among them) is their passion for what they do.
