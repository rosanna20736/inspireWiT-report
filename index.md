## Thank YOU for making inspireWiT 2018 happen! :sparkling_heart: :sparkles:

inspireWiT 2018 was held at the [Broadway cinema](http://www.broadway.org.uk/) in central Nottingham. Our aims for the conference were:

- To showcase brilliant women and people of gender minorities in tech
- To inspire and encourage women and gender minorities to get involved in tech
- To provide a network for those already in the field
- To encourage people of all genders to consider diversity
- To have fun, meet new people and learn new things!

Thank you so much for helping us to achieve those goals.

## The important bit

We sent out a feedback form to our attendees and got 39 responses. Of these **100%** said they felt the event was comfortable and inclusive and **90%** of them got to know someone they didn't know before the event. The comfort of our attendees and facilitating interactions are extremely important aspects of the event to us so we are _thrilled_ with this! :purple_heart:

## Tickets and attendee info

:sparkles: **102 attendees** :sparkles: checked in at the event. With sponsor representatives, speakers, workshop runners and volunteers included that came to 146 people at the event. 30% of those who registered for tickets were no-shows, which from word-of-mouth I understand is at the lower end of what is to be expected for free events of this nature.

Of those willing to state their gender on our booking form, 80% of our attendees were women. Just over half of the attendees were students, with most coming from the University of Nottingham and the University of Sheffield.
